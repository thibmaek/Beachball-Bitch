Beachball Bitch is game created in the Processing IDE as a school assignment.

The source is available in both Java and Processing.
You can grab the images from the .app package contents browsing to MacOS/Resources/data.
Feel free to make edits, learn from it (it's not flawless though...) but mention of course.
